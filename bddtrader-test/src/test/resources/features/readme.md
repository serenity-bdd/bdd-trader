# BDD Trader application

The BDD Trader application allows users to create and follow a portfolio of shares. 
It is made up of two layers: 
  * An AngularJS user interface
  * A set of REST APIs built using Spring Boot
  
Real-time trade data is obtained from the IEX API (https://iextrading.com/developer/)
